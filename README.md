# Software_Two
These projects are a part of the Software II Programming class from Ohio State University's Computer Science curriculum. Ohio State uses their own components, which you can find more information about at this link: https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/common/doc/.
Unlike in Software I, all projects were completed with a partner (except for WordCounter).
